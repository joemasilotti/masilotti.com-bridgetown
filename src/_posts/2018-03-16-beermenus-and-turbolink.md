As my [time in Croatia wraps up]({% post_url 2017-08-22-where-is-joe %}) I was given the opportunity to speak at a local meetup in Split, [Mobile Monday Split](https://www.meetup.com/mobilemondaysplit/). My presentation covered two topics: BeerMenus and Turbolinks. I dove into the Consumer and Retailer side of the BeerMenus business and explained how we use Turbolinks to quickly release new features to our four platforms.

## Some highlights

I walked through how BeerMenus supports desktop, mobile web, Android, and iOS with a small dev team.

[Mobile Monday Split](https://www.meetup.com/mobilemondaysplit/) meets every month or so and dives into all things development focused. Past topics include game development with Unity, native iOS and Android apps, and Continuous Integration. If you're ever near Split I highly recommend dropping by a session!
