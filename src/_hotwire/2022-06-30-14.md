title: "‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter - June 2022"

---

It‚Äôs been an entire _year_ since the first edition of the newsletter went out last June! I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôve grown from 200 to almost 2000 Hotwire developers in only a year.

To celebrate, I‚Äôve recapped the most popular articles of the past year. But first, let‚Äôs see what the Hotwire community has been up to.

First up, [Rails](https://discord.gg/bWTasVEZ) and [Hotwire](https://discord.gg/y6qef6yu) have their own official Discord channels! They are geared towards helping contributors and not general support forums. But if you're interested in contributing I recommend joining and saying hi.
