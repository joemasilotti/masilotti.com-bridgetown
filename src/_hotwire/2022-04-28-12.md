Less than 3 weeks until Rails Conf! Do you have [your ticket](https://www.railsconf.org/register)? If you‚Äôre attending make sure to read up on the [COVID safety requirements](https://www.railsconf.org/covid) for the conference as you will need to get tested before attending.

Outside of the talks and workshops there are also a few unofficial events going on, including a volunteer event and a board game night. Check out [Mike Perham‚Äôs event page](https://www.mikeperham.com/events/) for more details.

I‚Äôm excited to meet so many online friends IRL for the first time. If you see me then come say hi! I look a lot like that photo above. üòÉ

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Some personal updates

After many years of FactoryBot and RSpec I finally converted to test fixtures and minitest. Here's [my sane approach to test fixtures in Rails]({% post_url 2022-04-07-rails-test-fixtures %}).

Also, I was on the [Ruby on Rails podcast]({% post_url 2022-04-18-ruby-on-rails-podcast %})! We covered what it's like to build railsdevs in public.
