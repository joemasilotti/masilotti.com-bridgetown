Welcome back to the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter! [RailsConf tickets](https://railsconf.org/register) went on sale this week for the in-person event scheduled for May 17-19. I bought my ticket, how about you? I‚Äôm excited to meet folks in person ‚Äì¬†I feel like I‚Äôve connected with hundreds of new people over the past year online. It will be great to finally meet IRL.

Sadly, [my RailsConf proposal wasn‚Äôt accepted](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1507100497286610953?). So I‚Äôm going to run a remote workshop instead! It will cover porting your Rails app to iOS with Turbo Native and you won‚Äôt need any prior Swift experience. [Send me an email](mailto:joe@masilotti.com) if you‚Äôd like to attend and you‚Äôll be the first to know when I open registration. üí™

  body="This tutorial starts with an empty Rails 7 project then adds on a Turbo Frame, creates a Noticed notification, wires up ActionCable, and finally subscribes to the stream via Hotwire. It‚Äôs everything you need to set up a live-updating notification drawer in your Rails app. üîî"

  author="Peter Phillips"

  body="The main goal of this tutorial is to remember the open/closed state of the toggle for the user. Persisting in Kredis keeps the state consistent even if the user signs in on a different device. [Kredis](https://github.com/rails/kredis), by the way, is a gem that makes interacting with Redis a bit easier."
