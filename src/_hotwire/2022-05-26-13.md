My first RailsConf is officially over. üò¢

But I had an _amazing_ time [meeting folks IRL](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1527694963177291776) for the first time! If we didn't get to say hi then let me know and I'll make sure we meet at the next conference.

All told, I learned a lot. My favorite technical talk was [from Dave Copeland on why your app needs a service _layer_](https://twitter.com/davetron5000/status/1527371705009614850?s=20&t=OhW7b38nf9A_7w7QX2pJnw). Not necessarily service _objects_, but a spot where all of your business logic lives.

I took this to heart and have been [slowly refactoring the railsdevs codebase to extract a service layer](https://github.com/joemasilotti/railsdevs.com/pull/434). I'm not 100% sure this will get merged in, but it is definitely fun to experiment with a new approach.

I know the word "service" gets a bad rep in the Rails world. But I think it's worth exploring a new way to organize code every now and then.

Does your app have a service layer? Are you all in on a DSL/framework to help facilitate that? Or do you throw everything in Active Record models?

[Email](mailto:joe@masilotti.com) or [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti) with your thoughts ‚Äì I'd love to hear your take!
