Welcome back to the July edition of the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter! This newsletter was sent to almost 2000 developers ‚Äì I appreciate each and every one of you. ü§ó

If you missed RailsConf this year now's your chance to catch up on the recordings. All [67 videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbHJudTY1K0f1WgIbKCc0_M-XMraWwCmk) have been uploaded to YouTube. Not sure where to start? I list my favorite talks below.

Speaking of YouTube, I‚Äôm doing my first [Turbo Native live stream](https://youtu.be/vgLIWVWAYrg) later today. And I‚Äôd love if you could come and say hi! I‚Äôll be fielding questions at the end if you have anything you‚Äôd like to ask.

We also have so much content from Matt Swanson he gets his own section this month. üòÜ

## üéñ Achievement unlocked!

I hit a big achievement last week: shortest time from project kick-off to live in the App Store. I ported a client‚Äôs Ruby on Rails app to iOS and we went live in the App Store in 7 short weeks. üéâ

This is a huge milestone because it gets me closer to my dream of helping more folks get their businesses on iOS. I [wrote about the process on my blog](https://masilotti.com/zero-to-app-store-in-7-weeks/) diving into how it worked, the shortcuts we used, and how it all fit together.
