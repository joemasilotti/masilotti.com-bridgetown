Welcome back to the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter! If you check out one thing from this edition I recommend the Hotwire Example Template repository from Sean Doyle at thoughtbot. 19 (!) example Rails applications to play with all showcasing different Hotwire features in different git branches.

This month also links to a free (and open source!) course on building Rails apps with Turbo, a tutorial on how to create dynamic forms with Stimulus, and the annual Ruby on Rails survey from Planet Argon.

Don‚Äôt forget, the [RailsConf call for proposals (CFP)](https://cfp.rubycentral.org/events/railsconf-2022) submission deadline is due this weekend. My proposal is a talk on porting your Rails app to iOS with Turbo Native ‚Äì it‚Äôs my first RailsConf proposal so fingers crossed it gets accepted! ü§û
